This plugin adds version numbers to your downloadable software products in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

When using the [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) plugin to create an online store that sells digital downloads, this plugin will allow you to attach a version number to each of your products.

= What does this plugin do, exactly? =

This is a simple plugin that essentially does two things.

1. Adds a "Version" field to the EDD's "Download Configuration" meta box.
2. Adds the inputted version to the Download History table outputted from EDD's `[download_history]` shortcode.

= What about the EDD Software Licensing addon? =

To avoid redunancy, if you're using the [EDD Software Licensing](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/software-licensing/) addon, which already allows you to input a version number, this EDD Versions plugin will not add its "Version" field. And instead, your version number setup with the EDD Software Licensing addon will get used in the table outputted with `[download_history]`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `edd-versions` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. After activating this plugin, there will be a "Version" field added to the main "Download Configuration" meta box when configuring a downloadable product of [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/).

*Note: If you're using the [EDD Software Licensing](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/software-licensing/) addon, our plugin's "Version" field will not be displayed, and instead, the version number you setup with EDD Software Licensing addon will be used.*

== Screenshots ==

1. Version field added to EDD's "Download Configuration" meta box.
2. Version added to the `[download_history]` shortcode's outputted table.

== Changelog ==
